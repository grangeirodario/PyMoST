“Harnessing Python to Unveil the Sun’s Secrets: PyMoST Tracks and Analyzes Sunspots Across Solar Cycles”

We have developed an tool named the Python Morphological Sunspot Tracker (PyMoST). This code, crafted using the Python programming language, leverages the principles of mathematical morphology—a sophisticated image processing technique grounded in set theory.

The primary aim of PyMoST is to identify and track sunspots, providing an automated analysis of their physical evolution .

By employing PyMoST, researchers can gain valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of sunspots, which are crucial for understanding solar activity and its impact on space weather. This tool not only enhances our ability to study sunspots with greater precision but also contributes to the broader field of solar physics by offering a robust method for continuous and detailed observation.

The code is written in Python, version 3.11.5, using Jupyter Notebook, through Anaconda Python. For correct operation, it is necessary to install libraries that are not intrinsic to the Anaconda Python Project.
